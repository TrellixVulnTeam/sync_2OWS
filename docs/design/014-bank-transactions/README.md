# Bank transactions

Bank transactions allow exchange coins between accounts and get balance info.

## Goals and ideas

* Bank transactions should provide ability to perform following operations:
  * Send coins to another account
  * Get balance account
  
## Methods

As write above, bank transactions include method for *sending coins to another account* and method for *get balance account*.

### Sending coins between accounts

This operation has 5 steps:
* *Step 1.* Build a request for transferring coins. Example: `cheqd_ledger::bank::build_msg_send(account_id, second_account, amount_for_transfer, denom)`. [Read more about the step.](#build_msg_send)
* *Step 2.* Built a transaction with the request from the previous step. Example: `cheqd_ledger::auth::build_tx(pool_alias, pub_key, &msg, account_number, account_sequence, max_gas, max_coin_amount, denom, timeout_height, memo)`. [Read more about the step.](#build_tx)
* *Step 3.* Sign a transaction from the previous step. `cheqd_keys::sign(wallet_handle, key_alias, &tx)`. [Read more about the step.](#sign)
* *Step 4.* Broadcast a signed transaction from the previous step. `cheqd_pool::broadcast_tx_commit(pool_alias, &signed)`. [Read more about the step.](#broadcast_tx_commit)
* *Step 5.* Parse response after broadcasting from the previous step. `cheqd_ledger::bank::parse_msg_send_resp(&resp)`. [Read more about the step.](#parse_msg_send_resp)

#### <a name="build_msg_send">Create message for sending coins tx (cheqd_ledger::bank::bank_build_msg_send)</a>

Create message for building transaction. *Messages* are module-specific objects that trigger state transitions within the scope of the module they belong to. Other words messages contain the information for state transition logic.

* Required params:
  * `from` - coin sender address (`String`)
  * `to` - recipient address (`String`)
  * `amount` - amount of coins for sending (`String`)
  * `denom` - denomination of coins (`String`)

* Response is `MsgSend` after converting to bytes. But for clients using wrappers, the result of the function will be transmitted encrypted to bytes and does not require decryption.

Structure of `MsgSend`:

```Rust
pub struct MsgSend {
    pub from_address: String,
    pub to_address: String,
    pub amount: Vec<Coin>,
}
```

<br>

Example response (before converting to bytes):
```
{
  from_address: "cosmos1fknpjldck6n3v2wu86arpz8xjnfc60f99ylcjd",
  to_address: "cosmos1pvnjjy3vz0ga6hexv32gdxydzxth7f86mekcpg"
  amount: [Coin { denom: "cheq", amount: "100" }]
}
```

#### <a name="build_tx">Build tx (cheqd_ledger::auth::build_tx)</a>

Build transaction from a request. `build tx` returns an encoded transaction object that may be broadcasted to a pool.

* Required params:
  * `pool_alias` - a pool alias there we want to send the transaction (`String`)
  * `sender_public_key` - sender public key (`String`)
  * `msg` - encoded request from the previous step. It shouldn't be additionally encoded, request builder returns prepared data. Just put results of its work here. (`&[u8]`)
  * `account_number` - the account number of the account that want to transfer coins. (u64)
  * `sequence_number` - sequence number of tx that this account sent (u64)
  * `max_gas` - limits the amount of gas that can be used in a block. The default value is `-1`, meaning no limit, or that the concept of gas is meaningless. (`u64`)
  * `max_coin_amount` - the maximum amount the user is willing to pay in fees. (`u64`)
  * `coin_denom` - denomination for fees. (`String`)
  * `timeout_height` - block height until which the transaction is valid. (`u64`)
  * `memo` - a note or comment to send with the transaction. Can be empty string. Finally, it is put to a transaction log in a ledger. (`String`)

* Response is `SignDoc` after converting to bytes.

Structure of `SignDoc`:
```Rust
pub struct SignDoc {
    /// `body_bytes` is protobuf serialization of a transaction [`Body`] that matches the
    /// representation in a [`Raw`] transaction.
    pub body_bytes: Vec<u8>,

    /// `auth_info_bytes` is a protobuf serialization of an [`AuthInfo`] that matches the
    /// representation in a [`Raw`].
    pub auth_info_bytes: Vec<u8>,

    /// `chain_id` is the unique identifier of the chain this transaction targets.
    ///
    /// It prevents signed transactions from being used on another chain by an
    /// attacker.
    pub chain_id: String,

    /// `account_number` is the account number of the account in state
    pub account_number: AccountNumber,
}
```

<br>

Example response (before converting to bytes)
```
SignDoc { 
  body_bytes: [
    10, 139, 1, 10, 28, 47, 99, 111, 115, 109, 111, 115, 46, 98, 97, 110, 107, 46, 118, 49, 98, 101, 116, 97, 49, 46, 77, 115, 103, 83, 101, 110, 100, 18, 107, 10, 45, 99, 111, 115, 109, 111, 115, 49, 102, 107, 110, 112, 106, 108, 100, 99, 107, 54, 110, 51, 118, 50, 119, 117, 56, 54, 97, 114, 112, 122, 56, 120, 106, 110, 102, 99, 54, 48, 102, 57, 57, 121, 108, 99, 106, 100, 18, 45, 99, 111, 115, 109, 111, 115, 49, 110, 48, 57, 56, 100, 53, 99, 114, 51, 106, 122, 48, 109, 48, 114, 116, 120, 109, 102, 100, 51, 116, 110, 55, 106, 115, 55, 104, 56, 116, 99, 52, 109, 53, 118, 50, 107, 107, 26, 11, 10, 4, 99, 104, 101, 113, 18, 3, 49, 48, 48, 18, 4, 109, 101, 109, 111, 24, 233, 53], auth_info_bytes: [10, 80, 10, 70, 10, 31, 47, 99, 111, 115, 109, 111, 115, 46, 99, 114, 121, 112, 116, 111, 46, 115, 101, 99, 112, 50, 53, 54, 107, 49, 46, 80, 117, 98, 75, 101, 121, 18, 35, 10, 33, 3, 47, 165, 11, 249, 173, 204, 98, 247, 253, 79, 173, 94, 227, 12, 159, 27, 159, 176, 164, 57, 159, 220, 135, 67, 30, 191, 225, 72, 188, 85, 127, 125, 18, 4, 10, 2, 8, 1, 24, 10, 18, 15, 10, 9, 10, 4, 99, 104, 101, 113, 18, 1, 48, 16, 224, 167, 18

#### <a name="sign">Sign tx (cheqd_keys::sign)</a>
This necessary step to sign a transaction by an author for sending it to a ledger. The function uses transaction for signing in an encoded format. Just use an output from the previous step with building a transaction.

* Required params:
  * wallet_handle - a wallet identifier for geting keys for signing a transaction (`WalletHandle`)
  * key_alias - key alias of a cosmos account (`String`)
  * tx - transaction for signing (`&[u8]`)

* Response is `TxRaw` converting to bytes. `TxRaw` is a variant of Tx that pins the signer's exact binary representation of body and auth_info. This is used for `signing`, `broadcasting` and `verification`. The binary serialize(tx: TxRaw) is stored in Tendermint and the hash sha256(serialize(tx: TxRaw)) becomes the "txhash", commonly used as the transaction ID.

Structure of `TxRaw`:
```Rust
pub struct TxRaw {
    /// body_bytes is a protobuf serialization of a TxBody that matches the
    /// representation in SignDoc.
    #[prost(bytes = "vec", tag = "1")]
    pub body_bytes: Vec<u8>,

    /// auth_info_bytes is a protobuf serialization of an AuthInfo that matches the
    /// representation in SignDoc.
    #[prost(bytes = "vec", tag = "2")]
    pub auth_info_bytes: Vec<u8>,

    /// signatures is a list of signatures that matches the length and order of
    /// AuthInfo's signer_infos to allow connecting signature meta information like
    /// public key and signing mode by position.
    #[prost(bytes = "vec", repeated, tag = "3")]
    pub signatures: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
}
```

<br>

Example response (before converting to bytes):
```
Raw(TxRaw {
  body_bytes: [
    10, 139, 1, 10, 28, 47, 99, 111, 115, 109, 111, 115, 46, 98, 97, 110, 107, 46, 118, 49, 98, 101, 116, 97, 49, 46, 77, 115, 103, 83, 101, 110, 100, 18, 107, 10, 45, 99, 111, 115, 109, 111, 115, 49, 102, 107, 110, 112, 106, 108, 100, 99, 107, 54, 110, 51, 118, 50, 119, 117, 56, 54, 97, 114, 112, 122, 56, 120, 106, 110, 102, 99, 54, 48, 102, 57, 57, 121, 108, 99, 106, 100, 18, 45, 99, 111, 115, 109, 111, 115, 49, 101, 115, 104, 52, 114, 119, 55, 112, 101, 120, 101, 99, 97, 122, 103, 121, 52, 55, 55, 55, 50, 52, 101, 108, 48, 119, 116, 101, 106, 48, 56, 110, 113, 108, 103, 120, 106, 103, 26, 11, 10, 4, 99, 104, 101, 113, 18, 3, 49, 48, 48, 18, 4, 109, 101, 109, 111, 24, 186, 59

})
```

---

#### <a name="broadcast_tx_commit">Broadcast tx (cheqd_pool::broadcast_tx_commit)</a>

Broadcast the signed transaction to the network. This is possible because client connects to the node's RPC endpoint.

* Required params:
  * `pool_alias` - alias of pool (`String`)
  * `tx` - signed transaction for broadcasting(`Raw`)

* Response `TxResult` as String with following fields:
  * `check_tx` - checks the transaction without executing it. When a new transaction is added to the Tendermint Core, it will ask the application to check it (validate the format, signatures, etc.).
    * `check_tx::code` - if Code != 0, it will be rejected from the mempool and hence not broadcasted to other peers and not included in a proposal block.
    * `check_tx::data` - contains the result of the CheckTx transaction execution, if any. It is semantically meaningless to Tendermint.
    * `check_tx::gas_wanted` - is the maximum amount of gas the sender of a tx is willing to use.
    * `check_tx::gas_used` - is how much it actually used.
    * `check_tx::events` - include any events for the execution, though since the transaction has not been committed yet, they are /effectively ignored by Tendermint.
    * `check_tx::codespace` - the codespace is a namespace for the Code.
  * `deliver_tx` - returns a abci.Result, which includes a Code, Data, and Log. Tendermint sends the DeliverTx requests asynchronously but in order, and relies on the underlying socket protocol (ie. TCP) to ensure they are received by the app in order. They have already been ordered in the global consensus by the Tendermint protocol.
    * `deliver_tx::gas_wanted` - is the maximum amount of gas the sender of a tx is willing to use,
    * `deliver_tx::gas_used` - is how much it actually used,
    * `deliver_tx::data` - contains the result of the CheckTx transaction execution, if any. It is semantically meaningless to Tendermint.
    * `deliver_tx::events` - include any events for the execution, which Tendermint will use to index the transaction by. This allows transactions to be queried according to what events took place during their execution.
    * `deliver_tx::hash:transaction::Hash` - hash of transaction.
    * `deliver_tx::height` - height is a monotonically increasing data type that can be compared against another Height for the purposes of updating and freezing clients.
